Image segmentation- Brain tumor segmentation.
The goal of our brain tumor segmentation project is to develop computer algorithms that can automatically identify 
and delineate tumor regions within MRI scans. This process involves analyzing the 
intensity, texture, and spatial characteristics of the image to differentiate between tumor 
tissue and healthy brain tissue. By accurately segmenting tumor regions, clinicians can 
obtain quantitative measurements of tumor size, location, and growth rate, which are 
crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of patients with brain tumors.
